            <h2>Abstract</h2>

            In our project, we attempted to reproduct the work of a paper on OpenReview.net entitled <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1xAH2RqK7&fbclid=IwAR16FmCPpcFdWT0ZF3Qpg4x_bCVlbPMVe290sa4SQ6KrsHp8zmxG4aHU2PE" target="_blank">"Generative Adversarial Models for Learning Private and Fair Representations"</a>. This paper explores using a GAN architecture to create a decorrelation mechanism that hides a sensative variable while still preserving the utility of the original data. In our work, we attempted to replicate the architectures described in the paper through PyTorch with mixed results. It is our opinion that the results in this paper <mark><b>(blah blah blah)</b></mark>.

            <h2>Introduction / Background / Motivation</h2>
            What did you try to do? What problem did you try to solve? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
            <ul>
            <li> fairness is important (refrence previous work) </li>
            <li> this paper tries to learn task agnostic data Representation that preserves size and shape of data </li>
            <li> How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice? </li>
            <li> Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make? </li>

            </ul>

            <br><br>
            <!-- Approach -->
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <h4>What did you do exactly? How did you solve the problem? Why did you think it would be successful? Is anything new in your approach?</h4>


            differences include:

            <ul>
                <li>learning fairness Representations that are agnostic of downstream learning task </li>
                <li> inject noise where necessary rather than generating completley new synthetic data </li>


            </ul>

            <h4>What problems did you anticipate? What problems did you encounter? Did the very first thing you tried work?</h4>
            TODO

            <br><br>
            <!-- Results -->
            <h2>Experiments and Results</h2>
            <h4>How did you measure success? What experiments were used? What were the results, both quantitative and qualitative? Did you succeed? Did you fail? Why?</h4>
            TODO
