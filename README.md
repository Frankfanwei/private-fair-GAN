# ICLR Reproducibility Challenge: Generative Adversarial Models For Learning Private And Fair Representations

In our project, we attempted to reproduce the work of a paper on OpenReview.net entitled Generative Adversarial Models for Learning Private and Fair Representations. This paper explores using a GAN architecture to create a decorrelation mechanism that hides a sensative variable while still preserving the utility of the original data. In our work, we replicated the architecture described in the paper using PyTorch. We focused on reproducing the results for the UCI Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset.
